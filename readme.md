## Overview
Brownian Motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid, resulting from their collision with other atoms or molecules. In certain robot applications such as exploration, coverage, and swarm dynamics, simulating Brownian Motion behavior can be beneficial. This challenge involves implementing and simulating Brownian Motion behavior on a robot.


## Usage

1. Run the program
```ssh
python3 main.py
```
